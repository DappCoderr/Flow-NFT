## 🚀 Welcome to Flow Collectibles Portal Demo!
Welcome to the Flow Collectibles Portal project – a comprehensive learning experience centered around blockchain technology. This project is specifically designed to showcase the integration of smart contracts using the Cadence language on the Flow blockchain, coupled with a sleek Next.js frontend. 🌐

## 🔐 Getting Started
To dive into the world of Collectibles Portal, simply log in using your Blocto wallet. From there, you can seamlessly interact with the Flow blockchain, performing mutations and queries with ease. We've even included a helpful project structure to kickstart your journey.

## 📦 Project Structure
Your journey begins with an organized project structure, each component serving a unique purpose:

Cadence: This directory houses your Cadence smart contract code.
- `/contracts`: Smart contract files reside here.
- `/scripts`: Cadence scripts find their home in this directory.
- `/transactions`: For your Cadence transactions, look no further than this folder.

Frontend: Explore the frontend directory to find everything related to the user interface.
- `/src/app`: The heart of the frontend, where the app logic resides.
- `/src/app/page.css`: Style your app with this dedicated folder.
- `src/app/flow`: Configuration files for Flow can be found here.
- `flow.json`: This configuration file streamlines your project setup – think of it as your project's package.json, but worry not, the flow dev command will handle the details for you.
